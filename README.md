This project introduces an innovative hand-gesture-based calculator that offers a fast, 
efficient, and inclusive alternative to traditional input methods like physical calculators and 
abacus, while eliminating physical contact requirements. By leveraging real-time hand tracking 
via OpenCV and MediaPipe to interpret intuitive finger gestures as mathematical operations, 
enabling rapid arithmetic and trigonometric calculations. Its unique face authentication module 
adds a security layer absent in conventional calculation tools.
